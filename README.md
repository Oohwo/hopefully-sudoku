# Hopefully Sudoku

## Description
"Hopefully Sudoku" is currently a Python script that generates a solved sudoku puzzle from [grid.websudoku.com](grid.websudoku.com) through your terminal. I coded this in Python for fun and to prepare for CS242 (Introduction to Data Science) which primarily uses Python. Like [my other Minesweeper project](https://github.com/Oohwo/hopefully-minesweeper), I've been playing Sudoku since highschool as a hobby!

## How to Play Sudoku
1) TBA
2) Wanna play Sudoku yourself? I recommend this [website](https://www.websudoku.com).

## Demo
TBA

## Installation (Windows)
4) `py -m pip install bs4` (installs BeautifulSoup, used for webscraping)
5) Run `hopefully_sudoku.py`

You can also open this in your preferred coding IDE and run the file.

## Roadmap
- [x] Took a break from `hopefully_minesweeper.py`
- [x] Looked into how Sudoku puzzles are created (wow! combinatorics, backtracking algorithms, and more)
- [x] Have an epiphany:

- [x] Successfully learn how to webscrape and apply that to this project
- [x] Format the Sudoku board correctly
- [ ] Add logic and game functionality for the user to actually play Minesweeper
- [ ] Better Welcome Menu
- [ ] Options Menu (cheats enabled)
- [ ] Arrow-key navigation
- [ ] Potential YouTube video of the coding process (wouldn't that be funny? I totally didn't steal this README.md file [from my other project](https://github.com/Oohwo/hopefully-minesweeper/blob/main/README.md) hahahaha)

## Credits
- I learned how to webscrape with Beautiful Soup through this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQgXKtPSzUI)! I highly recommend learning how to webscrape yourself!
- I scraped data from [this server](https://www.grid.websudoku.com), be sure to check their website out!
- Shoutout to Johnny for competing against me in Minesweeper and Sudoku in highschool lol
